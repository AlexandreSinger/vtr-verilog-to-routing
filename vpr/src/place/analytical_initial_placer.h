// TODO: Name should be changed later. Can't use 'analytical_placer' lol.
//      Perhaps a directory structure would be more appropriate:
//          analytical_placement/
//              initial_placer/
//              global_placer/
//              detailed_placer/
//      Will have to fight the CMake for this...
