/**
 * @brief Estimator for the post-routing delays of the timing arcs between
 *        AP blocks, based on a flat placement.
 *
 * Timing arcs are identified by the AP sink pin that they terminate at. Every
 * AP sink pin corresponds to an atom sink pin, which identifies the timing arc
 * in the pre-cluster delay calculator.
 *
 * The delay of an arc is estimated as follows:
 *  - Arcs on global nets are not routed through the general routing network,
 *    so they are given the intra-cluster delay from the driver primitive pin
 *    to the boundary of its cluster plus the intra-cluster delay from the
 *    boundary of the sink cluster to the sink primitive pin, with no routing
 *    delay in between. This matches how VPR computes the delays of these arcs
 *    after packing.
 *  - Arcs on unrouted constant nets have no delay.
 *  - If the driver and sink blocks are in the same tile, they are assumed to
 *    be clustered together. The arc is given the delay of the intra-cluster
 *    path between the two primitive pins (if such a path exists).
 *  - If the arc can be implemented by a direct connection between clusters
 *    (see the <directlist> of the architecture) and the sink tile is at the
 *    offset of that direct connection from the driver tile, the arc is given
 *    the intra-cluster delays to and from the cluster boundaries plus the
 *    delay of the direct connection's switch. These pins often cannot connect
 *    to the general routing network at all (e.g. DSP cascades).
 *  - Otherwise, the arc is given the intra-cluster delay from the driver
 *    primitive pin to the boundary of its cluster, plus the inter-tile routing
 *    delay from the place delay model, plus the intra-cluster delay from the
 *    boundary of the sink cluster to the sink primitive pin.
 *
 * Arcs between atoms in the same molecule or the same chain are handled by the
 * pre-cluster delay calculator itself and are not affected by these estimates.
 *
 * All placement-independent quantities (the intra-cluster delays) are computed
 * once on construction, so updating the arc delays for a new placement is
 * cheap.
