 * contribute. Each remaining net contributes its tile-level bounding box
 * half-perimeter, weighted by the placer's crossing count for the estimated
 * number of tiles that the net connects.
 *
 *  @param p_placement  The flat placement to estimate the wire usage of.
 *  @param netlist      The AP netlist that the placement is over.
 *  @param device_grid  The device grid that the placement is over.
 *
 *  @return The estimated wire usage, in units of tile-length wire segments
 *          weighted by crossing count. This is a relative quality metric and
 *          should not be compared directly to routed wirelength.

/**
 * @brief Estimate the post-routing setup timing of the given flat placement.
 *
 * The delays of all timing arcs are re-estimated from the flat placement and
 * stored in the given delay calculator, then a full setup timing analysis is
 * performed with a new timing analyzer which uses that delay calculator.
 *
 * If the timing graph echo file for this estimate is enabled, the timing graph
 * (including the estimated delay of every edge) is written to it. This can be
 * compared edge-by-edge against the post-routing analysis timing graph echo
 * file, since both are over the same atom-level timing graph.
 *
 * NOTE: The arc delays in the given delay calculator are overwritten. Any
 *       timing info which shares this delay calculator (for example, the one
 *       owned by the pre-cluster timing manager) must be updated before its
 *       slacks and criticalities reflect these delays.
