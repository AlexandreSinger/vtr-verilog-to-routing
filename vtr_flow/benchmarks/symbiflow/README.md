SymbiFlow benchmarks
====================

This directory holds all the SymbiFlow benchmarks that are generated in the [SymbiFlow-arch-defs](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs) repository.

The circuits come along with the SDC constraints file, if present, and have been produced with yosys.
They are compatible with the symbiflow architectures produced in the same Symbiflow-arch-defs build.

All the data files can be downloaded with the `make get_symbiflow_benchmarks` target in the root directory.
